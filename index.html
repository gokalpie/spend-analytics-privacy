        <h1>Spend Analytics - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 9, 2025</p>

        <p>Spend Analytics values your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>Spend Analytics does <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information on external servers. All personal data, such as expenses, user-defined categories, and names, is stored locally on your device using <strong>Core Data</strong> and is not shared with the developer.</p>
        <p>However, Spend Analytics uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (for displaying ads)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These services may collect data such as your device type, IP address, advertising ID (IDFA), and interaction with advertisements to provide personalized or contextual ads.</p>

        <h2>2. App Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
        <p>Spend Analytics requests your permission to access your device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) to display relevant ads. You will be prompted to grant or deny this permission when you first launch the app, in compliance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All user-entered data is stored only on your device.</li>
            <li>Data is retained as long as the application is installed.</li>
            <li>When you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently deleted from your device.</li>
            <li>Spend Analytics does not store any personal data on external servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Spend Analytics does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we have unintentionally collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it promptly.</p>

        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or California, you have certain rights under the GDPR and CCPA, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access your data</li>
            <li>The right to correct or delete your data</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time</li>
            <li>The right to data portability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since Spend Analytics stores all data locally on your device, you can manage your data directly by deleting entries or uninstalling the application. For any concerns, please feel free to contact us.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and/or on this page, and the updated policy will include an effective date.</p>
